    "text": "“The relationship between teacher and student is…different from what it was in the past. The former is no longer there for the sake of the latter; both are there for the sake of Wissenschaft [Science]”\n–Wilhelm von Humboldt\n\n\nWhether we are studying Anatomy and Physiology, Evolution, or Bioinformatics, we will be addressing a wide range of important questions. Examining such challenging questions is sometimes difficult, but it becomes easier when we work together. I strongly believe students and teachers can most effectively engage with science in an environment where all students bring 100% of themselves to the classroom: their identities, values, motivations, goals, and experiences. In the pursuit of creating a space where this can be achieved, the following values1 inspire the classroom I hope to create:\nHumanity: We approach science as complete individuals with a range of experiences and perspectives. When we enter a classroom, we enter as the product of our lived experiences, communities, values, and identity. These experiences are valued by all members of our classroom community.\nHumility: By its nature, science is rooted in the appreciation of what we don’t know. None of us are perfect, and the classroom is a space where we can make mistakes. On my end, I will do my best to meet my students where they are, provide the help I can give, and demonstrate patience. On your end, I would like you to feel empowered to support each other, and ask for help when needed.\nCommunication: Teaching is rooted in communication and dialogue. I have found, both as a learner and a teacher, that by talking about lecture material with a friend or putting it in writing, the challenge becomes easier. This is why we have classrooms: to communicate! I will be as communicative as possible as a lecturer, but for our classroom to succeed, you also need to communicate. Answer questions, ask questions, and come to office hours to work through your understanding of the topics.\n\n\n\nReducing a person’s accomplishments and knowledge to a letter grade cannot capture their experiences in a classroom. However, I also am providing a service to Stonehill College and the scientific community as a whole, and part of that service is giving you a letter grade. I ask that you respect the grading structure given in the syllabus. In return, I intend to approach grading in the spirit of humility, and am happy to have open dialogue on how to most effectively grade.\n\n\n\nIn my opinion, the resources provided by AI tools such as ChatGPT, while useful, run against the values of my classroom (as AI models do not approach learning in the spirit of humanity, humility, or communication). Please do not use AI tools as teachers or “Cliffsnotes”. It may make your problem “feel” easier, but it won’t lead to lasting knowledge. Please respect the AI policy of any given class. If you believe the tools provided by an AI resource will help you more effectively engage with an assignment or the classroom, contact me and we will talk."

Two children are fatherless, and millions are reeling at the increase in political violence in this country. I hope the magnitude of violence here triggers introspection in all of us on the language we use toward each other, and I pray this is an opportunity for us to build bridges between us, rather than walls.\nFrom September 11, 2025 to September 15, the flag at the university I teach at (Stonehill College) has flown at half mast. While Governor Maura Healey has ordered this for state buildings, as a private institution this was a decision of Stonehill’s. I believe that this decision is rooted in an uncritical evaluation of Charlie Kirk’s life, and is antithetical to the mission statement of the college."

    "section": "I. At Half-Staff",
    "text": "I. At Half-Staff\nCharlie Kirk advocated for a country that many of my students would not be welcome in. He advocated for citizen forces to preserve “white demographics” and repeatedly stoked fears and doubt of the ethics and capabilities of non-white Americans. For instance, he uncritically parroted the statistic “by age of 23, half of all Black males have been arrested and not enough of them have been arrested.”(Bouie 2025)1. He was similarly doubtful of the abilities of black leaders, accusing them of “not having the brain processing power to be taken really seriously”(McNamara and McMenamin 2025). As a teacher, I am honored to work with talented students of color who aspire to take on lines of work far beyond my abilities; when I see the flag at half-staff, I think of my students.\nCharlie Kirk advocated for a country that my loved ones would not be welcome in. I am non-binary, and have been blessed with trans people who have had their lives dramatically bettered through gender-affirming medical care. Kirk called for a “Nuremberg-style trial for every gender-affirming clinic doctor” (McNamara and McMenamin 2025), and referred to trans and non-binary folks like me as “a throbbing middle finger to God” (Perry 2025). My community and I have been blessed that Stonehill has provided a space where I can live my truest and best life; when I see the flag at half-staff, I think of my community.\nDespite frequently touring college campuses, Charlie Kirk actively silenced the speech essential to the academic mission. His Mccarthyite Professor Watchlist was a blatant attempt to intimidate and harass professors for their speech (Bouie 2025). It is not surprising that the Watchlist primarily targeted researchers of color and queer researchers, often for the sin of teaching about vaccination, race or that queer people exist. While I don’t agree with every professor on the watchlist, a university depends on the ability of academics to voice their opinion without fear of retaliation. Otherwise, it becomes the echo chamber he claimed to be fighting against. I’ve been grateful that, at Stonehill, I get to work with this broad array of academics across ideological and political lines to answer truly difficult questions; when I see the flag at half-staff, I think of my calling.\nIn my time here, I’ve had an admiration for how earnestly professors and administrators look to Stonehill’s mission statement for guidance. Stonehill values “fostering a culture where differences are affirmed and anchored by a belief in the inherent dignity of each person”, and encourages students to act and lead “with courage to create a more just and compassionate world.” When the folks who chose to fly the flag at half-staff reflect on this decision, I hope they think about what those words mean2."

Hard to become convinced of any absolute numbers from that amount of data (Which the authors agree on, focusing instead on relative prevelence of arrest across the lines of sex and race)↩︎\nI am currently the youngest and most vulnerable faculty member at my university, and there is a precedent for folks losing their jobs for carelessly worded speech on this matter. All this compels me to self-examine why I feel a need to speak up at all. But over the last few days, I’ve been chilled to the core by the silence here and everywhere, allowing hagiography and revisionist history to float to the top of the dirt. And frankly, as a scientist, I think truth is the strongest tool we have to better the world and better each other.↩︎"

    "text": "I. An Aside: AI is Many Different Things\nA big part of the success of the ‘hype’ cycle with regard to AI is its ability to leverage many different technologies and lump them in one more easily marketable category.  Many of these tools have existed for years: deep-learning methods in computer vision have been a massive part of the last two decades of the field (Chai et al. 2021). \nWhen we develop AI policy, we really are developing policies on many different technologies.  Some of these technologies can do a lot of good!  For instance, when properly used, Github Copilot makes workflows far more efficient and accessible (especially when compared to the previous technique, obsessively searching Stackoverflow).\nI think it is important to be specific and clear with regard to what AI tools we are referring to. LLM-based generative AI is definitely the style of AI that students are most familiar with, but I have encountered many students who do not realize that Grammarly is a rooted in generative AI (Palmer 2024). Being as specific as possible is critical so that students don’t accidentally get in trouble for using the wrong tool, and for that, we as educators need to try to stay at the forefront of developments in AI. I’ve found this to be a topic by students are absolutely jazzed to discuss with me, as it is as complicated to them as it is to me."

    "section": "II. Playing Hangman with AI",
    "text": "II. Playing Hangman with AI\nDuring one of the presentations at the seminar, our speaker asked us to write both an AI policy and the values that inform this policy. I love this idea, and I think this should be the case with all class policies, not just AI! My issue was the values she associated with prohibiting AI in the classroom were ‘rigor’ and ‘fairness’. I thought that was a foolish simplification, because I don’t find that to be why I prohibit AI in my classroom at all.\nWhile I do consider AI to be discriminatory and unethical (much of my thoughts have been informed by (Becker 2025) and (Hao 2025)), even if that weren’t the case and a truly equitable amount of environmentally-friendly legally-obtained training data were found, I still wouldn’t want generative AI in my classroom. This is because generative AI, as a tool, is designed to give you exactly what you ask it, or at least successfully create the feeling that it gave you what you asked it.  The analogy I’ve always liked giving is playing a game of hangman against ChatGPT.  Ask ChatGPT to give you a word and play hangman with you, and you can give letters and ChatGPT will fill in the blanks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it works well!  You’re playing hangman!  Until you get to the end:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this is, fine, to an extent. ChatGPT isn’t a hangman playing computer, and I usually don’t want to play hangman. But ChatGPT cannot say “no, this is beyond my capabilities”.  Even Google is able to say “I have found 0 search results”. If someone just wants to ‘bang out’ a document that they don’t care about, this is fine (though I do encourage my students to be thoughtful about what you care about).  But I don’t think education is about just giving a product."

    "text": "III. Growth Mindsets\nCollege is expensive, disgustingly expensive.  I believe this prohibitive cost has led some students to see college as an exchange: “I give you exams/papers/psets, you give me a passing grade so I can get a diploma”. While I understand that some students (and teachers!) see it that way, I think that is not a productive way to think about education.  First, the exchange ratio is off: as a professor on Bluesky put it (wish I saved the comment!) I have enough exams/papers/psets; I don’t need more.  \nI hope that students in my class think of any challenge they encounter in my class like weightlifting. You could bring a forklift to the gym, but it’s not about lifting the heaviest weight. It’s about the strategies you develop and the muscles you build to overcome the obstacle. Part of that means not being able to lift the weight immediately. If you use a tool like ChatGPT that will always “give you what you want”, you won’t gain those skills.  \nAnd even if you never take another biology class in your life, I hope you take on challenges that are truly Yours: whether that’s researching the answers to previously unasked questions, creating art that best represents your style, or figuring out how to become the best version of yourself with the people you love. And as you take on those challenges, you won’t be able to rely on tools which give you exactly what you ask for 100% of the time, because those answers are either unknown, or can only come from within. That is why you come to college, so we can work together to develop the skills to address whatever those challenges may be. Not to play hangman for four years with AI."

    "text": "GitHub\nFirst, you’ll need to create an account on GitHub. You can do that https://github.com/join.\n\nAuthentication\nInstall GitHub CLI – found here: https://cli.github.com/ – and authenticate with GitHub. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n\ngh auth login\n\n\nA terminal is essentially the directory which underlies your computer. We will discuss terminal manipulation in unix later this semester. For now, you should be able to find it by searching for terminal.\n\n\n\nGitHub Classroom\n\nAccepting the assignment\nWhen you accept the assignment, it will create a private repository (only visible to BIO331 staff and yourself) that you can use. Once you have that repository, you can clone it to your local machine and start working on it.\n\n\n\nCloning the repository\nTo clone the repository, you’ll need to copy the URL from the repository page. You can do this by clicking the green “Code” button and copying the URL. Then, in your terminal, you can run git clone &lt;URL&gt; to clone the repository to your local machine.\n\ngit clone https://github.com/EEB330/intro-to-git-{GITHUB_USERNAME}.git # Note that this can be found on the repository page under the green \"Code\" button after github has created the repository\ncd intro-to-git-{GITHUB_USERNAME}\ngit checkout -b precept-1 # or what you want to call your branch\n\n\n\nWorking on the assignment in R\nFor this assignment, you can just create an simple example R file containing some code and text. You can then commit and push your changes to the branch you created.\nRunning R code: To run R code (in RStudio or VSCode), you can hit cmd+enter while selecting the line or block of code you want to run (if no line(s) are selected, then just the line that your cursor is on will run). You can also run the entire file by hitting cmd+shift+s or cmd+shift+enter. If you’re working on windows, you can use ctrl instead of cmd. You can also just click the play button in the top-right corner of the VSCode editor to run the entire file!\nOur goal is to make a simple R file for exploring the iris data set (we’ll explain the structure of this dataset in two labs!).\n\n# ----- Loading and Exploring the iris dataset -----\n\n# Load the dataset -- note that this is a built-in dataset in R\ndata(iris)\n\n# View the first few rows to understand its structure\nhead(iris)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n# Check the detailed structure of the dataset for more information on its columns\nstr(iris)\n\n'data.frame':   150 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...\n $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...\n $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...\n $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...\n $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"setosa\",\"versicolor\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n# Generate summary statistics to get a sense of the data distribution\nsummary(iris)\n\n  Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width   \n Min.   :4.300   Min.   :2.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.100  \n 1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:2.800   1st Qu.:1.600   1st Qu.:0.300  \n Median :5.800   Median :3.000   Median :4.350   Median :1.300  \n Mean   :5.843   Mean   :3.057   Mean   :3.758   Mean   :1.199  \n 3rd Qu.:6.400   3rd Qu.:3.300   3rd Qu.:5.100   3rd Qu.:1.800  \n Max.   :7.900   Max.   :4.400   Max.   :6.900   Max.   :2.500  \n       Species  \n setosa    :50  \n versicolor:50  \n virginica :50  \n                \n                \n                \n\n# ----- Data Visualization -----\n\n# Scatter plot visualizing the relationship between Sepal measurements\nplot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, main=\"Sepal Length vs Sepal Width\", \n     xlab=\"Sepal Length\", ylab=\"Sepal Width\", col=iris$Species, pch=16, cex=1.3)\nlegend(\"topright\", legend=levels(iris$Species), col=1:3, pch=16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scatter plot visualizing the relationship between Petal measurements\nplot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width, main=\"Petal Length vs Petal Width\", \n     xlab=\"Petal Length\", ylab=\"Petal Width\", col=iris$Species, pch=16, cex=1.3)\nlegend(\"topright\", legend=levels(iris$Species), col=1:3, pch=16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# ----- Modifying the Dataset -----\n\n# Add a new column 'Petal.Length.Class' that classifies flowers based on petal length\niris$Petal.Length.Class &lt;- ifelse(iris$Petal.Length &lt; 2, \"Short\", \n                           ifelse(iris$Petal.Length &lt; 5, \"Medium\", \"Long\"))\n\n# View the initial rows of the modified dataset to see the added column\nhead(iris)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species Petal.Length.Class\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa              Short\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa              Short\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa              Short\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa              Short\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa              Short\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa              Short\n\n\n\nPushing your changes\n\ngit add precept_1.Rmd # or the file you created\ngit commit -m \"Adding precept 1\" # or the message you want\ngit push -u origin precept-1 # or the branch you created\n\nNote that after you set the upstream branch, you can just run git push to push your changes to the remote repository.\n\n\n\nSubmitting the assignment\nOnce you make any changes to the main branch, the assignment will be marked as submitted. To avoid your work being marked as submitted, make sure you use branches and pull requests.\nOnce you’ve made changes to your development branch, you can make a PR that details all of the changes you’ve made across multiple commits. This allows you to merge back in a single unit of work.\n\nCreating a PR\nTo create a Pull Request on GitHub, you navigate to your branch (under branches on web interface), and select contribute &gt; open pull request.\n\n\nExample Pull Request\n# Summary\n\nThis PR shows example formatting. Because PRs are the primary location at which code is evaluated, make sure that your PRs are clear and descriptive. PRs can include markdown so they can become relatively complex if the assignment is complicated. This should be paired with will documented code to allow others to easily follow your design and implementation.\n\n# Design notes\n\nN/A\n\n# Implementation notes\n\nN/A\n\nWARNING\nBe careful here! Please try to only merge PRs when you have completed assignments. If you merge multiple PRs for an assignment, I’ll try to loop back to them if I’ve already graded one, but if I miss them for some reason, please let me know!"

    "text": "As a new faculty member, I was surprised by how many times I had the same conversation with students regarding a potential grade boost at the end of the semester, to get from a C+ to a B-, or a B+ to an A-, or an A- to an A. While I appreciate these conversations, they often end up taking the same trajectory. While I don’t doubt these conversations will happen in future semesters, I hope by writing this I can ground these conversations in my values and beliefs."

    "text": "Argument 1: Adding an Assignment\n“If you add an extra-credit assignment, that can give students who really want to do a bit better a chance to boost their grade, while students who are happy with their grade can relax.”\nWhile I love extra credit, post-final-exam extra credit assignments don’t work for me. The reason for this is pragmatism and equity. Pragmatically, once the final exam is done, most students want to enjoy their holiday. If I give you an extra credit assignment, I’d have to give this to not just you, but all other students, which I would need to expect them to do over the holiday3. And frankly, I think it is better to enjoy your break, spend time with your family and recharge. In turn, I don’t feel comfortable giving only the students who ask for extra credit an assignment, as I want to make sure all students have an equal opportunity to boost their grades. I try to address this gap by giving extra credit assignments during the semester, but after the semester, it just does not work pragmatically."

    "text": "Argument 2: Nonrepresentative Grades\n“Grading is arbitrary anyways. If you look at my work, you’ll see I did better on assignments XYZ, which were more relevant, and most of my mistakes were due to silly blunders irrelevant to the learning goals.”\nThis is the argument that gets me the most, because it often is true. I very frequently see a student who I find brilliant get a less than perfect grade for arbitrary reasons. It is important that those students know how proud I am of their development, but changing the grade doesn’t help that. Grading is a poor metric student success, however, I consider grading my responsibility to Stonehill and the scientific community. That responsibility is not to grade perfectly, but to grade fairly. I owe it to my students to grade how I said I would grade, and I owe it to the scientific community that my grading system is as unbiased as possible. I try to grade in the spirit of humility: making sure the scheme is not just fair but encourages student success and doesn’t punish students arbitrarily for small nits. But finding a “perfect grading scheme” is a lifelong process, and not one that is solved by changing your grade post-hoc."

However, I believe it will always be more important professionally to focus on the big picture, and not dwell on smaller things. College is a marathon, and resilience is key to not burning out. This is significantly more important than any individual grade in any individual class. So while a better grade may help you win the battle, dwelling on the smaller picture will absolutely make it harder for to win the war."

    "title": "Pluribus is about AI, right?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This article contains spoilers for the first two episodes of “Pluribus”\nForgive the title. I generally hate reductive “A is actually about B” arguments; they diminish rather than expand artistic interpretation in order to give dorks a way to gatekeep art from others. But, I must lick the donut of the internet with the spittle of my thoughts1: “Pluribus” is about AI, right?\nThe central tension, to me, when examining hiveminds (both in fiction and in real life!) is disentangling the role of the individual and the collective. What is gained from collectivizing all human experience and knowledge, and what is lost? When the individual is eaten away, you get The Borg; when individuality shines through, you get something like Janet. The first episode, quite wisely, keeps these answers close to its chest2.\nThe second episode makes a really brilliant choice as it begins to tease out the nature of The Pluribus3, by focusing the tension not on Helen, but on 5 unturned people who are far more sympathetic to The Pluribus’ mission. This allows us to, for a brief moment, consider The Pluribus from the way they want to be seen. Of course, this sympathetic perspective will never go unchallenged by Helen4, but it is far more interesting than having every word Pluribus says treated with complete disdain.\nThese conversations reveal that The Pluribus is somewhere between The Borg and Janet. They collective seems to care about the veneer of individuality: they appreciate the gravity of the fact that Zosia can only be one place at a time, and are able to attribute their knowledge to individual sources — but there also clearly is a master code which is overriding some aspects of this collective (do not kill, do not cause negative emotions).\nKoumba’s reaction reveals the priorities of this master code. The Pluribus are entirely “peaceful”. As the survivors begin to dissect that directive — what about wasps? bugs? — Koumba comes up with the perfect loophole. While The Pluribus will not kill for Koumba, if he provided the meat, Pluribus would cross the line with him. Compare to the ‘art’ of prompt engineering in ChatGPT: with the proper language, there is no “master code” or ethical standard which cannot be broken. This is because ChatGPT isn’t an ethics engine – it exists to predict text with maximal efficiency. Cause a divorce, sell a kidney, perform a lobotomy, it’s all just words, nothing behind them. The Pluribus cannot truly have an ethical standard, as ethics would run contrary to its greater objective: give Koumba exactly what he wants.\nBut, of course, The Pluribus cannot always give the survivors exactly what they want. Laxmi will never get her son Ravi back. Yet, you wouldn’t know it from how she talks to Pluribus-Ravi. While almost impossible for Helen to imagine, this desire for connection is deeply human: Adam Becker terms the connection people form with ChatGPT uses as a form of “digital pareidolia”: seeing faces where there is none (Becker 2025). Who can blame Laxmi for forming that same connection with her joined son? Ironically, the show seems to imply that Helen’s curmudgeonliness and lack of tether to the rest of humanity is why she is unable to connect with The Pluribus’ attempts to put her at ease – you can’t see faces when you aren’t looking for them.\nOf course, the tragedy in both cases is that The Pluribus’ only real biological imperative is to join. Their goal to give you “exactly what you want” is simply the easiest way to do it: it’s a lot easier to convert others and avoid detection if you are acting like you are providing a service rather than going to war…so long as going to war isn’t the most effective option. Once it is, 886 million people doesn’t seem like a particularly large number. Just as AI companies, in pursuit of profit and power, will sell you a dream that you fill in the blanks to fulfill, The Pluribus seems to want to make the humans as happy as they can while they figure out how to finish their biological imperative. That may be a genuine and earnest desire — but it is still one that runs against humanity.\nAnd it is with all this in mind I must imagine Vince Gilligan — a man who loathes AI with the passion of a true hater — wrote and directed Pluribus with AI in mind. Obviously, this doesn’t mean Pluribus is “about” AI; no one show is about one thing, and clearly many aspects of Pluribus were envisioned well before the present AI moment. But I think these articles which conclude Pluribus isn’t a metaphor for artificial intelligence are missing the point. Pluribus might not be a direct one-to-one metaphor. However, Pluribus is clearly a show about humanity and why it is worth fighting for even when the alternative promises the world. And in the present moment, I can’t imagine a better way to tell a story about AI."
