    "text": "“The relationship between teacher and student is…different from what it was in the past. The former is no longer there for the sake of the latter; both are there for the sake of Wissenschaft [Science]”\n–Wilhelm von Humboldt\n\n\nWhether we are studying Anatomy and Physiology, Evolution, or Bioinformatics, we will be addressing a wide range of important questions. Examining such challenging questions is sometimes difficult, but it becomes easier when we work together. I strongly believe students and teachers can most effectively engage with science in an environment where all students bring 100% of themselves to the classroom: their identities, values, motivations, goals, and experiences. In the pursuit of creating a space where this can be achieved, the following values1 inspire the classroom I hope to create:\nHumanity: We approach science as complete individuals with a range of experiences and perspectives. When we enter a classroom, we enter as the product of our lived experiences, communities, values, and identity. These experiences are valued by all members of our classroom community.\nHumility: By its nature, science is rooted in the appreciation of what we don’t know. None of us are perfect, and the classroom is a space where we can make mistakes. On my end, I will do my best to meet my students where they are, provide the help I can give, and demonstrate patience. On your end, I would like you to feel empowered to support each other, and ask for help when needed.\nCommunication: Teaching is rooted in communication and dialogue. I have found, both as a learner and a teacher, that by talking about lecture material with a friend or putting it in writing, the challenge becomes easier. This is why we have classrooms: to communicate! I will be as communicative as possible as a lecturer, but for our classroom to succeed, you also need to communicate. Answer questions, ask questions, and come to office hours to work through your understanding of the topics.\n\n\n\nReducing a person’s accomplishments and knowledge to a letter grade cannot capture their experiences in a classroom. However, I also am providing a service to Stonehill College and the scientific community as a whole, and part of that service is giving you a letter grade. I ask that you respect the grading structure given in the syllabus. In return, I intend to approach grading in the spirit of humility, and am happy to have open dialogue on how to most effectively grade.\n\n\n\nIn my opinion, the resources provided by AI tools such as ChatGPT, while useful, run against the values of my classroom (as AI models do not approach learning in the spirit of humanity, humility, or communication). Please do not use AI tools as teachers or “Cliffsnotes”. It may make your problem “feel” easier, but it won’t lead to lasting knowledge. Please respect the AI policy of any given class. If you believe the tools provided by an AI resource will help you more effectively engage with an assignment or the classroom, contact me and we will talk."

    "text": "Recently, I attended a professional development seminar at Stonehill focused on the use of AI in the classroom, run by The Generator, which made me reflect on my own values with regard to AI in the classroom. When I wrote on my values this summer, I intentionally kept the AI section vague. This was because I didn’t want to commit to a singular policy, but it was also because I had a lot of thoughts on the topic I wanted to expand on."

    "text": "I. An Aside: AI is Many Different Things\nA big part of the success of the ‘hype’ cycle with regard to AI is its ability to leverage many different technologies and lump them in one more easily marketable category.  Many of these tools have existed for years: deep-learning methods in computer vision have been a massive part of the last two decades of the field [Chai et al. (2021)]. \nWhen we develop AI policy, we really are developing policies on many different technologies.  Some of these technologies can do a lot of good!  For instance, when properly used, Github Copilot makes workflows far more efficient and accessible (especially when compared to the previous technique, obsessively searching Stackoverflow).\nI think it is important to be specific and clear with regard to what AI tools we are referring to. LLM-based generative AI is definitely the style of AI that students are most familiar with, but I have encountered many students who do not realize that Grammarly is a rooted in generative AI (Palmer 2024). Being as specific as possible is critical so that students don’t accidentally get in trouble for using the wrong tool, and for that, we as educators need to try to stay at the forefront of developments in AI. I’ve found this to be a topic by students are absolutely jazzed to discuss with me, as it is as complicated to them as it is to me."

    "section": "II. Playing Hangman with AI",
    "text": "II. Playing Hangman with AI\nDuring one of the presentations at the seminar, our speaker asked us to write both an AI policy and the values that inform this policy. I love this idea, and I think this should be the case with all class policies, not just AI! My issue was the values she associated with prohibiting AI in the classroom were ‘rigor’ and ‘fairness’. I thought that was a foolish simplification, because I don’t find that to be why I prohibit AI in my classroom at all.\nWhile I do consider AI to be a discriminatory and a societal toxin (much of my thoughts have been informed by (Becker 2025) and (Hao 2025)), even if that weren’t the case and a truly equitable amount of environmentally-friendly legally-obtained training data were found, I still wouldn’t want generative AI in my classroom. This is because generative AI, as a tool, is designed to give you exactly what you ask it, or at least successfully create the feeling that it gave you what you asked it.  The analogy I’ve always liked giving is playing a game of hangman against ChatGPT.  Ask ChatGPT to give you a word and play hangman with you, and you can give letters and ChatGPT will fill in the blanks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it works well!  You’re playing hangman!  Until you get to the end:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this is, fine, to an extent. ChatGPT isn’t a hangman playing computer, and I usually don’t want to play hangman. But ChatGPT cannot say “no, this is beyond my capabilities”.  Even Google is able to say “I have found 0 search results”. If someone just wants to ‘bang out’ a document that they don’t care about, this is fine (though I do encourage my students to be thoughtful about what you care about).  But I don’t think education is about just giving a product."

    "text": "III. Growth Mindsets\nCollege is expensive, disgustingly expensive.  I believe this prohibitive cost has led some students to see college as an exchange: “I give you exams/papers/psets, you give me a passing grade so I can get a diploma”. While I understand that some students (and teachers!) see it that way, I think that is not a productive way to think about education.  First, the exchange ratio is off: as a professor on Bluesky put it (wish I saved the comment!) I have enough exams/papers/psets; I don’t need more.  \nI hope that students in my class think of any challenge they encounter in my class like weightlifting. You could bring a forklift to the gym, but it’s not about lifting the heaviest weight. It’s about the strategies you develop and the muscles you build to overcome the obstacle. Part of that means not being able to lift the weight immediately. If you use a tool like ChatGPT that will always “give you what you want”, you won’t gain those skills.  \nAnd even if you never take another biology class in your life, I hope you take on challenges that are truly Yours: whether that’s researching the answers to previously unasked questions, creating art that best represents your style, or figuring out how to become the best version of yourself with the people you love. And as you take on those challenges, you won’t be able to rely on tools which give you exactly what you ask for 100% of the time, because those answers are either unknown, or can only come from within. That is why you come to college, so we can work together to develop the skills to address whatever those challenges may be. Not to play hangman for four years with AI."

My dissertation is on the collective behavior of bees, at both the individual-level and the colony-level.\nOver the time, I have learned a great deal on raising bumblebees, insect biology, mathematical modeling, and developing bioinformatics pipelines to understand social behavior. I am always excited to talk science, and I love collaboration! I am especially excited to chat with Stonehill students who are looking to develop skills in data visualization, programming, or biological modeling, or who are working on a project where utilizing these skills will be useful.\nMy other passion has been developing my skills as an educator. I have a deep passion for teaching incarcerated students, working as an educator and course coordinator for the Prison Teaching Initiative in New Jersey. If you are interested in working with incarcerated students, get in touch!\nWhether you’re a student, a bee biologist, or an educator, I hope the resources I provide on this site can be helpful!\nMy CV"
